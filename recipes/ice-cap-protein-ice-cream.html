    <h2>The <strong>BEST</strong> tasting ice cream ever.</h2>

    <p>This protein ice cream simply tastes amazing. It tastes very similar to Tim Hortans's ice cap. The fact that it's also healthy is insane. As seen in the image above, you can also add oreo cookies to it making it cookies and cream ice cap protein!</p>

    <p>This meal is best enjoyed while watching your favorite TV show. Enjoy your guilt free ice cream experience.</p>
